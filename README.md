## Project Overview

This is a website developed as part of a practical in the Work Integrated Learning subject. This website was created using **HTML** and **CSS** in Visual Studio Code.

The Empowering the Nation website is an educational and community-focused platform designed to showcase a variety of short and long courses offered to learners across South Africa. 

The platform provides users with a clear, easy-to-navigate interface to view course information, contact details, and inspiring content aligned with the organisation’s mission.

The website was developed to meet the requirements of the POE, which includes creating a functional website, and maintaining consistent design and structure across all platforms.

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The purpose of the Empowering the Nation website is to serve as an accessible digital platform that promotes skills development and lifelong learning opportunities for individuals across South Africa. Guided by our mission and vision, the website aims to connect people with practical training in domestic, vocational, and technical fields that enhance employability, entrepreneurship, and self-reliance.

It provides a user-friendly space where learners can explore available courses, understand their benefits, and take the first step toward personal and professional growth. By showcasing our programmes, values, and success-driven approach, the website supports our vision of building a skilled, confident, and self-reliant society where every individual has the opportunity to learn, earn, and uplift others.

## Design Considerations

The design of the **Empowering the Nation website** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The website was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The website was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

5. **Design Consistency**: 
- Navigation menu and footer are identical across all pages.
- Each page uses a simple and accessible layout for clarity and readability.
- The React Native app mirrors the website design to ensure cross-platform consistency.
